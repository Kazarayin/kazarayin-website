      This archive contains the ancient whispers and cultural ghosts that inspired my saga.<br>
      Some are real. Some are reimagined. All of them are watching.

    <!-- ENTRY: SEA JINN -->
    <div class="folklore-entry">
      <h2>The Sea Jinn – بودريا</h2>
      <p>
        From Bahraini folklore, بودريا is said to drown divers and pull swimmers to their deaths in unknown ways.

          In my world, he is one of the Darakthul Kingdom — the most feared kingdom among both Jinn and Humans.

    <!-- ENTRY: MOTHER OF A DONKEY -->
    <div class="folklore-entry">
      <h2>The Mother of a Donkey – أم حمار</h2>
      <p>
        A female jinn known to stand by roads at night asking someone to stop and

        <span class="more-text">
          give her a ride to her destination. The legend says that whoever picks her up is never seen again.<br>
          The only way to tell if she’s real is to look at her feet — they resemble a donkey’s.

          of its victims. It has one leg, one hand, and a long tongue. Its victims are often those who get lost
          or wander off the road. It sneaks into camps at night when no one is awake.<br>
          Some have reported hearing faint whispers of “Koi... koi... koi...” in the dark.
