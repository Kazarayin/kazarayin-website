      <h2>The Dancing Jinn</h2>
      <p>
        We sang to celebrate. But something else was listening.

       After graduation, four friends go camping at a beach buried in the desert sands. They expected music, laughter, and memories.
       They didn't expect the voices.
       They didn't expect the melody to sing back.
       And Alex... he can't stop hearing it.
