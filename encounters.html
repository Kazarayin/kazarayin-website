    <h1>Encounters from the Other Side</h1>
    <p class="encounters-intro">
      These aren’t stories.  
      These are memories I wish I could explain away.  
      But they happened. And they changed me.<br>
      I was living in a <strong>Haunted House</strong>.
    </p>

    <!-- ENCOUNTER 1 -->
    <div class="encounter-entry">
      <img src="candle.png" alt="Candle Icon" class="candle-icon" />
      <h2>The Old Lady</h2>
      <p>
        I was in high school when this happened.
        <span class="dots">...</span>
        <span class="read-more">
          I was in my room, reading — when I heard my name whispered right beside me.  
          I turned... nothing. I searched the entire house. I never found anything.  
          That night, I couldn’t sleep — because every time I closed my eyes, I heard breathing that wasn’t mine.

      <img src="candle.png" alt="Candle Icon" class="candle-icon" />
      <h2>The Flying Clothes</h2>
      <p>
        Again, I was in high school when this occurred.
        <span class="dots">...</span>
        <span class="read-more">
          I was walking home when I saw a man wearing an orange jacket standing still under a flickering streetlight.  
          He didn’t move. Not even when I passed him. But later that night…  
          I saw the same man standing outside my window. Still wearing the same jacket.  
          And my house was two stories up.
