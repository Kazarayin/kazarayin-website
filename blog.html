      I don’t blog. I don’t post often.  
      But sometimes the silence speaks — and this is where I let it echo.

        Stories aren’t born — they break through.  
        Between what I say and what I bury, there are whispers.  
        This space is for them. I won’t promise weekly posts, or even consistency.  
        But when something claws its way out, I’ll leave it here.  
        Maybe someone will find it. Maybe that someone is you.

        It wasn’t a sound. Not really.  
        It was silence bending around the wrong corner of my mind — like something was speaking *between* thoughts.  
        I wasn’t afraid. Not yet. But I stopped writing for a week after that.
        <br><br>
        I didn’t know it at the time, but that moment would become the seed for what is now <em>Between Two Worlds</em>.  
        You might call it imagination. Or inspiration.  
        I call it a visitor.
