        <strong>K.A. Zarayin</strong> is the pen name of Bahraini writer Khalil Albinkhalil — a conjurer of cursed worlds, haunted bloodlines, and forbidden tongues.  
        His dark fantasy saga <em>Between Two Worlds</em> is a descent into realms inspired by folklore, ancient jinn legends, and the delicate art of shadowed storytelling.
        <br><br>
        He writes first in Arabic, then crosses dimensions to shape English versions that haunt both minds and margins.  
        His dream? To give the world one the best horror novels, that people will remember for years to come.
        His ambition is to see his saga unfold not only on the page... but on the big screen, where darkness flickers brightest.
